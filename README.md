# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Analysis

Credit cards are one of the major sources of revenue for banks. Given that customer acquisition costs are higher than customer retention costs, it is important for banks to measure a customer's likelihood to churn such that they could proactively take targeted preventive actions.

In this project, we will explore the credit card customer data to identify the factors of attrition based on their demographic profile, financial status, and transaction history.

This dataset contains 10000 customers of which 16% have churned. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and can be accessed through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers
